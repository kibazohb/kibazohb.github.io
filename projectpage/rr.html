					<h4>Background</h4>
					<p>Every year, multiple teams across the world come together to compete at the Internatinal Autonomous Robot Racing Competition in Waterloo.
					It's fun, and exciting to see how teams set up their robots on the starting line to compete in different races.</p>

					<p>The team held down the fort and together we were able to implement most of the planned features, including a Machine Learning based traffic light detection, a simulation of our robot and algorithm to remove shadows from camera images. 

					This was my first major robotics project and I was lucky to work with a team of talented individuals. I was responsible for handling the IMU sensor, 
				    improving the robot's path planning algorithm and also cleaning the code base</p>

					<h4>RESULTS</h4>
					<p>
				    	Although we did not place in the top 3 teams we're very proud of what we were able to achieve. We placed 4th out of 12 competing teams from all over the world. Footage from one of our races is given below. Special thanks to Oluwatoni Ogunmade, Jack Xu, Matthew Post, Angela Gu, Brian Tran, Yun-Ha Jung, Adrian Malanaran, Waleed Ahmed Andrew Jin and Tsugumi Murata for their amazing work and inspiration.
