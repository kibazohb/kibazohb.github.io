					<h4>Background</h4>
					<p>A memorable and exciting 12-hour hackathon at Scotiabank Toronto with a unforeseen theme of Gamification. Scotiabank wanted its customers to learn more about the services they provided but also have fun at the same time. It was made clear that the problem was open-ended, and unique ideas were encouraged.

					<h4>Our Approach</h4>
					<p>Our main strategy was to leverage AR technology and use it market Scotiabank's services. My team and I then formalized an Augmented Reality experience by using an AR browser.  

					The scotiabank logo was used as an image marker to trigger the AR experience. Whenever it was scanned, a link to a trivia quiz would then pop up on the screen. Clearly the trivia quiz was used to satisfy the gamification requirement and also inform customers about the serivces at the same time.</p> 
					<p>I focused on the writing the back-end for the Trivia Quiz with Flask framework and setting up the AR features with ARAF browser.</p>

					<p>Inorder to make it more interesting, our team decided to introduce a points system as well. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, we were not able to implement it, but we included it in the presentation as a feature to be added. </p>

						Special thanks to my incredible team members Tawana Mphusu, Shreyal Shah and Olayiowola Bakare.

					<h6><p>Technologies used: Flask, Python, ARAF browser, Typescript.</p></h6>
