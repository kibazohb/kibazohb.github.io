                        " I am here to provoke you! ", said the opening speaker. YORK U HACKS (2018) was the first hackathon held at York University at it was all about bringing change to the society.
                        The main speaker came through with a mind-opening speech, motivating us to work on ideas and solve problems that brought a positive impact to society and not just ideas that lead to personal monetary gain.

                    <h4>Our approach</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every community has a great amount of talent and dreams and insightful ideas, but sometimes they are laid to waste.
                        As a team we decided to build a web based application, that served as a platform for local people could "TEAM UP" to share and work on ideas 
                        that would lead to positive change towards their society. For instance, building basketball courts in a neighbourhood. </p>

                    <p>
                        Using Angular Web Framework, I was able to serve a role in building the frontend for this application.
